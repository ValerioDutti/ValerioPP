        <h4>"My muse is Nature"</h4>
        <p>Originally from Ukraine, Valerii Vavrysevych worked as a model before stepping behind the lens to explore his own creative vision. As a photographer he is inspired by the beauty of our Earth.  Valerii  produces gorgeously expressive and lucid imagery striking a balance between light and nature. In certain cases, he also acts as set-designer creating stunning landscapes for his beautiful subjects to exist in. His universe cannot leave anyone indifferent: the incredibly rich and well-curated color palette, combined with his graphic, almost essential compositions, turn his photographs into wonderful painting-like creations.</p>
